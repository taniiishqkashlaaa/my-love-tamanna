📄 Project Document — Catch The Hearts Game (Next.js Web Game)
1. Project Overview

Catch The Hearts is a simple arcade-style browser game built using Next.js.
The player controls a character positioned at the bottom of the screen and must catch falling hearts.

A total of 10 hearts will fall from the top one by one.
Each heart falls straight downward in a linear path, but the horizontal starting position changes randomly for every heart.

The goal is to catch as many hearts as possible before all 10 have fallen.

2. Core Gameplay Concept
Objective

The player must move left and right to align underneath falling hearts and catch them before they hit the bottom boundary.

Game Duration

Exactly 10 hearts fall per game session.

After the 10th heart finishes falling, the game ends automatically.

Scoring

Score starts at 0

Each caught heart increases score by 1

Final score is displayed as:

Score: X / 10

3. Game Screens / Flow
3.1 Start Screen (Initial State)

When the website loads:

Show a centered title: Catch The Hearts

Display a Start Button

Game does not begin until user clicks Start

UI Elements

Title text

Start button

Action

Clicking Start transitions into gameplay

3.2 Gameplay Screen (Main Game)

This is the playable area where:

Hearts fall from the top

Character moves at the bottom

Score is shown at top-right

UI Elements

Play area container

Falling heart sprite

Player character sprite

Score counter: Score: X/10

3.3 End Screen (Game Over)

After all 10 hearts have finished falling:

Show Game Over text

Display final score

Provide a Try Again button

UI Elements

Final Score text

Restart button

Action

Try Again resets the game and returns to Start Screen or restarts immediately

4. Game Rules & Mechanics
4.1 Falling Hearts Logic

Hearts fall one at a time

Total hearts per round: 10

Each heart begins at:

y = 0

x = random position within game width

Hearts move downward at constant speed until reaching the bottom boundary.

4.2 Catch Condition (Important)

A heart is counted as caught only if:

The player character is positioned directly underneath the heart

At the moment the heart reaches the player’s “catch line”

📌 Catch Line Definition:

The catch line is the top boundary of the player sprite (head/top portion).

So the heart is caught only when:

heart.bottom >= player.top
AND
heart.x overlaps player.x range


If the player is not aligned underneath at that exact moment, the heart is missed.

4.3 Miss Condition

A heart is considered missed if:

It reaches the bottom boundary without overlapping the player’s horizontal position

Missed hearts do not increase score.

5. Player Controls
5.1 Desktop Controls

Left Arrow → Move character left

Right Arrow → Move character right

Movement should be smooth and continuous while holding the key.

5.2 Mobile Controls

On touch devices:

Player can drag the character left or right

Character follows finger movement along the x-axis only

No vertical movement allowed.

6. Game Layout Requirements
Play Area

Fixed rectangular container centered on screen

White or minimal background

Heart spawns from top inside this area

Character Placement

Always stays near bottom

Moves only horizontally

Score Placement

Displayed at top-right corner

Format:

6/10 Score

7. Assets & Visual Style
Sprites

Heart sprite: pixel-art red heart

Player sprite: small character/avatar standing at bottom

Animation Style

Hearts fall smoothly downward

Character movement is responsive and fluid

8. Technical Requirements (Next.js Implementation)
Framework

Next.js (App Router preferred)

Rendering

Use HTML Canvas OR DOM-based animation (either acceptable)

Game loop using requestAnimationFrame

State Management

Game state should include:

Current screen (start, playing, gameover)

Current heart index (1–10)

Heart position (x, y)

Player position (x)

Score count

9. Game Logic Sequence
Step-by-step Loop

Show Start Screen

On Start click → Begin game

Spawn heart #1 at random x

Animate falling downward

Player moves left/right

When heart reaches catch line:

If overlapping player → Score +1

Else → Miss

Spawn next heart

Repeat until 10 hearts completed

Show End Screen with final score

Try Again resets everything

10. Reset Conditions

On restart:

Score resets to 0

Heart counter resets to 0

Player returns to center bottom

Screen returns to Start or Gameplay depending on design

11. Deliverables Expected from AI Code Generator

The AI should generate:

Full Next.js project structure

Game component

Start screen UI

Game logic for 10 falling hearts

Catch detection

Keyboard + touch movement

Score display

End screen + restart button

Clean responsive layout for desktop and mobile
